### The Challenge
As the **Vehicle Dynamics Lead**, I was tasked with redesigning the rear suspension to withstand 4-foot drops while minimizing bump steer.

### Methodology
1. **Geometric Optimization:** Used Lotus Shark to simulate suspension travel.
2. **FEA Validation:** Imported the SolidWorks model into ANSYS to test control arm loads.
3. **Manufacture:** Machined components using 4130 Chromoly steel.

### Results
* Reduced unsprung mass by **15%**.
* Achieved **zero bump steer** through 6 inches of travel.
