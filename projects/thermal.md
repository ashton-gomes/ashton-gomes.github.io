### Problem Statement
In high-performance fluid systems, excessive heat buildup can lead to pump cavitation and efficiency loss. This study analyzed the thermal performance of a proposed heat exchanger design.

### Analysis & Simulation
1.  **Modeling:** Created a 3D fluid volume model in **SolidWorks**.
2.  **CFD Setup:** Configured **ANSYS Fluent** with k-epsilon turbulence models to simulate fluid flow and heat transfer coefficients.
3.  **Data Processing:** Post-processed simulation data in **MATLAB** to visualize temperature gradients and pressure drops.

### Results
* Identified a recirculation zone causing hot spots in the original design.
* Proposed a baffle modification that increased heat transfer rate by **12%** while maintaining acceptable pressure drop limits.
