## About Me
I am a Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook University, specializing in **Vehicle Dynamics, Control Systems, and Mechatronics**. 

Currently, I serve as the Vehicle Dynamics Lead for Stony Brook Motorsports (Baja SAE), where I design and validate steering, suspension, and braking systems for off-road competition vehicles.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Custom Shock Dynamometer (Senior Design)
*Designed and fabricated a custom Scotch Yoke mechanism to characterize suspension damping.*
* **Tools:** SolidWorks, MATLAB, DAQ, VFD
* **Status:** In Progress (Aug 2025 - Present)
* [View Project Details](#) *(Link coming soon)*

### 2. 7 DOF Manipulator Analyzer
*Engineered a Python-based kinematic suite to solve Inverse Kinematics and trajectory planning.*
* **Tools:** Python, NumPy, Robotics
* **Status:** Completed (Dec 2025)
* [View Simulation](#) *(Link coming soon)*

### 3. Vehicle Dynamics Lead
*Led a 12-person team to deliver 100% on-time design and fabrication of Baja SAE vehicle subsystems.*
* **Impact:** Reduced turning radius by 33% via geometric optimization.
